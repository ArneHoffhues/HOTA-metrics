Annotation Format

The annotations are png images for each frame.
The png format has a single color channel with 8 bits.

Each pixel that belongs to the same object has the same value in this png map.
Start at 1 for the first object, then 2, 3, 4 etc.
The background (not an object) has value 0.

These can be read like this:

import PIL.Image as Image
img = np.array(Image.open("000005.png"))

or like this:

ann_data = tf.read_file(ann_filename)
ann = tf.image.decode_image(ann_data, dtype=tf.uint8, channels=1)
